# U-Net Convolutional Networks for Cell Segmentation

## Motivation  
---

Cell segmentation is a critical part of epidemiological research. Automating the cell segmentation process can enable increased research throughput, reduce the time-to-market for drugs, and reduce the strain on research staff.  

## Problem Definition
---  

The goal of this project is to implement, train, and test a model that is capable of accurately segmenting cells, automatically.  

## Methodology  
---

In order to accomplish this task we implemented a U-net convolutional neural network.
